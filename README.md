# Trajectory Optimization

Welcome to the Trajectory Optimization project! This repository contains code and resources for optimizing the trajectories of probes.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.
    - **Minimum Fuel Orbit Transfer Optimization.ipynb**: This notebook addresses the problem of optimizing the trajectory of a spacecraft for a minimum fuel orbit transfer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). The optimization problem involves determining the optimal thrust and thrust angle profiles that minimize fuel consumption while   satisfying the spacecraft's dynamic constraints and boundary conditions.
    - **Interplanetary Trajectory Optimization.ipynb**:The goal is to transfer a spacecraft from Earth's orbit to Jupiter's orbit, minimizing the total transfer time. The spacecraft uses a low-thrust propulsion system, and the trajectory is optimized to satisfy physical constraints.
    - **Solar Sail Trajectory Optimization.ipynb**: The goal is to determine the optimal trajectory for a solar sail spacecraft to transfer from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) while minimizing the time required. The spacecraft is propelled by the pressure of sunlight, and the trajectory is governed by the sail orientation angle.

# Trajectory Optimization

Welcome to the Trajectory Optimization project! This repository contains code and resources for optimizing the trajectories of celestial bodies.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used for trajectory calculations.
- **scripts/**: Includes Python scripts for performing trajectory optimization.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.
    - **01_data_exploration.ipynb**: Notebook for exploring and visualizing the datasets.
    - **02_initial_trajectory.ipynb**: Notebook for setting up and visualizing initial trajectory parameters.
    - **03_optimization.ipynb**: Notebook for running and analyzing trajectory optimization algorithms.
    - **04_results_analysis.ipynb**: Notebook for analyzing and visualizing the results of the optimization.
- **results/**: Directory for storing output results and plots.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trajectory_optimization.git
        ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
